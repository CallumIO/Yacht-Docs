### Yacht-Docs
The documentation is built with [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

To get started you can:
1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. Run `pip install mkdocs-material`
3. Run `mkdocs serve` and you can access the preview at http://localhost:8000
4. When you're done submit a PR and I'll check it out and merge it.
